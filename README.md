CoffeeMachine

TO OD
- [x] working prototype
- [ ] rewrite the code for something more "readable"

Bugs
- [ ] when on low water level, elevator motor randomly starts and stops (starts the initialize sequence) (hardware related?)
- [ ] sometimes the "make coffee" button restarts the system (just like pulling down the RESET pin) (software or hardware related?)
- [ ] sometimes elevator wont stop at the bottom (probably bottom limit switch is starting to fail) (hardware related?)
